# FoxTaildMod
Gives players fox tails...
I think the name is pretty self explanatory.
It's a 1.19 fabric mod. It's also my first public repo.

Maybe one day there will be way to config which players have the tails.
It is also possible to scale the tail using the "Fox" button in player's survival inventory.

"player-renderer-fun-idk-1.2r.jar" is the ready to go mod jar.
